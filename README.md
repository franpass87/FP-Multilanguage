## About
FP Multilanguage keeps an English copy of Italian content aligned across posts, pages, custom post types, taxonomies, menus, media metadata, and SEO tags. It enforces dedicated `/en/` routing, browser-based redirects, and English-specific sitemaps while integrating with real translation providers (OpenAI, DeepL, Google Cloud Translation, LibreTranslate). The plugin ships with a diagnostics dashboard, REST tools, and WP-CLI commands for queue management.

* **Text Domain:** `fp-multilanguage`
* **Domain Path:** `/languages`

## Features
- Differential translation queue that reprocesses only modified fragments and preserves Gutenberg, ACF, and shortcode structures.
- Automatic duplication for posts, CPTs, taxonomies, WooCommerce product attributes, navigation menus, and media text fields.
- Provider adapters with configurable pricing metrics to estimate OpenAI, DeepL, Google, and LibreTranslate costs.
- Frontend locale override, English sitemap generation, hreflang/canonical management, and browser language redirects.
- Assisted mode when WPML or Polylang is active to avoid conflicts while keeping glossary/override tooling available.
- Diagnostics snapshot with queue KPIs, REST actions, and WP-CLI commands for batch runs, cleanup, and queue retention.

## Installation
1. Upload the `fp-multilanguage` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install the generated ZIP from the Releases tab.
2. Activate the plugin via **Plugins → Installed Plugins** in WordPress.
3. Visit **Settings → FP Multilanguage** to configure providers, glossary rules, routing, and automation options.
4. Run an initial sync from the Diagnostics tab or via `wp fpml queue run` to populate English copies.

## Usage
- Create or edit Italian content; the queue enqueues incremental jobs that translate the touched sections into English.
- Monitor queue size, job age, provider health, and cost projections from **Diagnostics → Queue**.
- Configure WP-Cron or a system cron to execute `wp fpml queue run` and keep translations up to date when `DISABLE_WP_CRON` is enabled.
- Use REST diagnostics buttons or WP-CLI (`wp fpml queue cleanup`, `wp fpml queue estimate-cost`, `wp fpml queue status`) for maintenance tasks.
- Enable assisted mode automatically when WPML/Polylang is detected to retain overrides without duplicating content.

## Hooks & Filters
| Hook | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fpml_post_jobs_enqueued` | action | Fires after English duplicates are enqueued for a source post. |
| `fpml_translatable_post_types` | filter | Adjust the list of post types processed by the queue. |
| `fpml_translatable_taxonomies` | filter | Control which taxonomies receive English counterparts. |
| `fpml_queue_cleanup_states` | filter | Define the job states eligible for cleanup retention. |
| `fpml_queue_after_cleanup` | action | Runs after a queue cleanup completes with statistics. |
| `fpml_queue_cleanup_batch_size` | filter | Override the batch size used while cleaning queue entries. |

## Support
Create an issue at <https://github.com/francescopasseri/FP-Multilanguage/issues> or contact <https://francescopasseri.com> for enterprise assistance.

## Development Workflow
- Run `npm install` to install JavaScript tooling (conventional-changelog CLI).
- `npm run sync:author` — Synchronise author metadata across plugin headers, readme files, and manifests. Use `APPLY=true npm run sync:author` to write changes.
- `npm run sync:docs` — Align documentation references (currently reuses the author sync script with documentation mode).
- `npm run changelog:from-git` — Generate or update `CHANGELOG.md` based on conventional commits.
- `composer run build` — Produce a production-ready build in `fp-multilanguage/vendor`.

## Assumptions
- GitHub issues at <https://github.com/francescopasseri/FP-Multilanguage/issues> serve as the public support channel.
- Conventional commits (Angular preset) are used for changelog generation.

## Release Process
See [README-BUILD.md](README-BUILD.md) for full build prerequisites. Typical release flow:
1. Update the version with `bash build.sh --bump=patch` or `--set-version=X.Y.Z`.
2. Run `npm run changelog:from-git` and review `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Execute `composer run build` to assemble the distributable ZIP in `build/`.
4. Upload the ZIP to WordPress or GitHub and tag the release as `vX.Y.Z`.
